## Protein-Protein Correlation
### Introduction:
A protein is expressed as correlation vector with N other proteins. Our attempt is to understand the protein-protein correlation translated to the graph structure. The graph theoritic construct is expected to elevate our understanding of this correlation providing us the information of

Protein community detection which can work as biomarker pannel
Centrality of a protein help us to understand the central role among the correlation and ranking of the proteins
Correlation based model can be implemented to cluster the proteins
Link prediction technique can be implemented to specific protein-pair to redefine and predict ill defined link or correlation
